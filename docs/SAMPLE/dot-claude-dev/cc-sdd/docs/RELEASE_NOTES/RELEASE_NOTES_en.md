## 📝 Ver 2.0.3 (2025-11-15) – GPT-5.1 Codex tuning

- Refined recommended OpenAI models for Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf to explicitly include `gpt-5.1-codex medium/high` as the primary code-focused option, with `gpt-5.1 medium/high` as a general-purpose fallback.
- Updated DEV_GUIDELINES-related tests so they match the stricter language-handling rules introduced in v2.0.2, keeping runtime behavior unchanged while ensuring `npm test` passes cleanly for v2.0.3.

- Resources: [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md#203---2025-11-15), PR: [#104](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/104)

## 📝 Ver 2.0.2 (2025-11-15) – GPT-5.1 & spec stability

- Optimized prompts and agent defaults for GPT-5.1 by recommending `GPT-5.1 high or medium` for Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf.
- Tightened language handling so all generated Markdown (requirements, design, tasks, research, validation) uses the spec’s target language and falls back to English (`en`) when `spec.json.language` is not set.
- Made EARS patterns and traceability more consistent by keeping EARS trigger phrases in English, localizing only the variable slots, and enforcing numeric requirement IDs (e.g. `Requirement 1`, `1.1`, `2.3`) so requirements → design → tasks mappings are stable and fail fast when IDs are missing or invalid.

## 🎉 Ver 2.0.0 (2025-11-09) – Stable Release

### Highlights at a Glance
- **`npx cc-sdd@latest` = full stack SDD**: all alpha capabilities (research.md, validation commands, Subagents, Windsurf) are now GA.
- **Spec-to-impl fidelity**: Research/Design/Tasks templates now enforce requirement IDs, component density rules, and Supporting References for long-form details.
- **Brownfield guardrails**: `/kiro:validate-*` commands, parallel-task analysis, and steering-wide project memory reduce drift before any code change.
- **Global parity**: 7 AI agents × 13 languages share the same templates, prompts, and installation flow.

### Upgrade Essentials
1. Follow the [Migration Guide](../guides/migration-guide.md) for template layout changes (`.kiro/settings/templates/*`) and new steering behavior (directory-wide load).
2. Update automation/scripts to call `npx cc-sdd@latest` (the `@next` tag is reserved for future previews).
3. Regenerate steering + spec templates once to pick up Research.md, the new design rules, and tasks parallel markers.

### Key Capabilities in this release
- **Parallel Task Analysis** – automatic `(P)` markers + `--sequential` escape hatch.
- **Research.md Template** – isolates discovery logs and architectural trade-offs from the design SSOT.
- **Design Template Overhaul** – summary tables, requirement coverage, Supporting References, and heavy component blocks only where they matter.
- **Agent Coverage** – Claude Code + Subagents, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Copilot, Qwen, Windsurf with matching 11-command workflows.
- **Interactive Installer** – guided setup with project-memory handling, npm badges, and improved documentation navigation.

### Resources
- Full technical diff: see [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md#200---2025-11-09).
- Migration specifics: [docs/guides/migration-guide.md](../guides/migration-guide.md).
- PLAN references: `docs/cc-sdd/v2.0.0/PLAN.md` for release tasks, `docs/cc-sdd/v2.0.0/PLAN2.md` for design-template scope.

Once your project templates are regenerated on v2.0.0, all spec/todo automation should operate without additional flags.
