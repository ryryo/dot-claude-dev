- [English](docs/RELEASE_NOTES/RELEASE_NOTES_en.md)

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.5] - 2026-01-08

### Added
- Add Greek (el) language support, bringing total to 13 languages ([#121](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/121))

## [2.0.4] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- Update GitHub Copilot prompt files to replace deprecated `mode` attribute with `agent` ([#118](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/118))
- Fix registry.ts with review improvements ([#107](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/107))

### Documentation
- Add AI-Assisted SDD book reference to documentation ([#109](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/109))

## [2.0.3] - 2025-11-15

### Changed
- Refine recommended OpenAI models for Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf agents to prioritize `gpt-5.1-codex medium/high`, keeping `gpt-5.1 medium/high` as a general-purpose fallback.

### Fixed
- Align DEV_GUIDELINES-related tests with the stricter language-handling rules introduced in v2.0.2 so `npm test` passes cleanly for v2.0.3.

- PRs: [#104](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/104)

## [2.0.2] - 2025-11-15

### Changed
- Align templates, rules, and prompts with GPT-5.1 by updating recommended OpenAI model names for Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf agents to `GPT-5.1 high or medium`.
- Tighten language handling so all generated Markdown (requirements, design, tasks, research, validation) uses the spec’s target language (`spec.json.language`) and defaults to English (`en`) when unspecified.
- Make EARS patterns and requirements traceability more consistent by keeping EARS trigger phrases (`When`, `If`, `While`, `Where`, `The system shall`, `The [system] shall`) as fixed English fragments, localizing only the variable slots, and enforcing numeric requirement IDs across all phases (e.g. `Requirement 1`, `1.1`, `2.3`) with fast failure when IDs are missing or invalid instead of falling back to free-form labels.
- PRs: [#102](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/102)

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-10

### Changed
- Improve README clarity and visual consistency ([#93](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/93), [#94](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd/pull/94))

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-09

### Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: Please review the [Migration Guide](docs/guides/migration-guide.md) when upgrading from v1.x.

2. **Steering**: Now loads entire `steering/` directory instead of single file
3. **File Extensions**: Templates use actual extensions (`.md`, `.prompt.md`, `.toml`)
4. **Command Count**: Expanded from 8 to 11 commands (3 validation commands added)

### Migration from v1.x
